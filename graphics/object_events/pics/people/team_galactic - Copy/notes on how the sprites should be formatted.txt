Alright. But the order of the sprites is messed up (that's on me, not on you)
The sprites need to be rearranged in this format, with each frame being a 32x32 segment:
Input frame 1 needs to be output frame 2.
Input frame 2 needs to be output frame 8.
Input frame 3 can be kept the same.
Input frame 4 needs to be output frame 9.
Input frames 5-7 need to be output frame 10-12, respectively.
Input frame 8 needs to be output frame 6.
Input frame 9 needs to be output frame 7.
Input frame 10 needs to be output frame 1.
Input frame 11 needs to be output frame 4.
Input frame 12 needs to be output frame 5.
How would I do this in Python 2.7?
